# filmnia

With filmnia you can search for films and series by logging in to your account created on themoviedb.org, being able to bookmark, mark as watched and create lists of films and series, all linked to your account on themoviedb.org. If you already have an account and contain some favorites or lists, don't worry, all of that will be loaded into your film after login.

# overview code

filmnia was my first experience as an iOS developer using the Swift language, the code still lacks 100% architectural concepts and not even the famous "clean code", the development of the app was done focused on studies, so don't be scared by some codes "repetitive" or lack of something that could have been better coded. tks!
